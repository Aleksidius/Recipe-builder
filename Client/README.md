# RECIPE NUTRITION CALCULATOR
## / Recipe Builder /

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.


## Main Description
The **Recipe Builder** is the final Project Assignment at Telerik Academy Aplpha with JavaScript - 2019.

The project goal is to design and implement a single-page web application that will allow restaurant chefs to create and manage recipes composed of products with known nutrition values. During the interaction with the system users see changes in nutrition information in real time. Newly created recipes could be tagged with a category from a list.

The application has a public part (accessible without authentication) and a private part (available only for registered users - chefs)

### Public Part
The public part is visible without authentication. 
It consists of a registration screen, where every new user can make a registration, and a login screen, which users use to authenticate.


**Users can Register/Login**
